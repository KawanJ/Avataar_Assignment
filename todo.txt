General:
- Disable smooth resizing of chrome to look at navbar updates more clearly

Minor:
- Fix "Maximum Update Depth succedded error" which happens sometimes: "react-dom.development.js:86 Warning: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render."
