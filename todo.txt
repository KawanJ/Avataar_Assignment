NavBar:
- Finish Navbar Dropdown according to Figma


Errors:
- Handle error when 0 links are visible and it still attemts to pop (this only happens when window width gets extremely low)

Major Issues:
- If all Items go into More, resizing back up doesnt work

Minor Issues:
- Dropdown items appear reverse fix that (using shift)
- Refreshing page while window size is less adds 2 overflowing items instead of 1 (just fix using a checking function at this point)
